wallabag API.

# Requirements

-   `httpie` installed on your computer ([see project
    website](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie)). Note that you can also
    adapt the commands using curl or wget.

    https://app.wallabag.it/api/doc (on your instance) and [on our
    example instance](https://app.wallabag.it/api/doc)
