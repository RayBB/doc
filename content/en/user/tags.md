Tags are a great way of organizing your saved content in order to more easily access it at a later time.

## Adding Tags

Tags may be added when saving content (e.g. using the Chrome extension Wallabagger) or by opening the content in Wallabag and clicking the "Add a Tag" button on the sidebar.

## Retreiving Content by Tag

From the home page, simply click tags on the sidebar in order to access your list of content tags. Click the your tag to access any content which is labeled with it!
