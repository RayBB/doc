In each saved article you read, you can write annotations. It's easier to
understand with some pictures.

Select the part of the article that you want to annotate and click on
the pencil:

![Select your text](../../../img/user/annotations_1.png)

Then, write your annotation:

![Write your annotation](../../../img/user/annotations_2.png)

The text is now highlighted and you can read your annotation if you move
the mouse cursor over it.

![Read your annotation](../../../img/user/annotations_3.png)

You can create as many annotations as you wish.
Note that the annotation is visible when you read the article from wallabag, not when you browse the original page on the web.
